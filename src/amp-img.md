### <a name="amp-img"></a> `amp-img`

A runtime-managed replacement for the HTML `img` tag.

#### Behavior

The runtime may choose to delay or prioritize resource loading based on the viewport position, system resources, connection bandwidth, or other factors. The `amp-img` components allows the runtime to effectively manage image resources this way.

`amp-img` components, like all externally fetched AMP resources, must be given an
explicit size (as in width / height) in advance, so that the aspect ratio can be known without fetching the image. Actual layout behavior is determined by the layout attribute. If the resource requested by the `amp-img` component fails to load, the space will be blank. A placeholder background color or other visual can be set using CSS selector and style on the element itself.

The `amp-img` includes attributes for denoting attribution via the attribution attribute.

Additional image features like captions can be implemented with standard HTML - using the `figure` and `figcaption` elements, for example.

#### Attributes

**src**

Similar to the `src` attribute on the `img` tag. The value must be a URL that
points to a publicly-cacheable image file. Cache providers may rewrite these
URLs when ingesting AMP files to point to a cached version of the image.

**srcset**

Same as `srcset` attribute on the `img` tag. The behavior will be polyfilled where not natively supported.

**alt**

A string of alternate text, similar to the `alt` attribute on `img`.

**attribution**

A string that indicates the attribution of the image. E.g. `attribution=“CC courtesy of Cats on Flicker”`


#### Styling

`amp-img` can be styled directly via CSS properties. Setting a grey background
placeholder for example could be achieved via:

    amp-img {
      background-color: grey;
    }
